**Step 1:**

Inside the given file "data.json", create the JSON object to store one pet which is up for adoption. It must have the following instance variables (i.e, properties)

- Name
- Type of Animal
- Breed
- Date of Birth
- Medical Conditions (can be more than one)
- Photo, which is stored as a URL to an image file (can find an image from Google and paste in the URL here)

**Step 2**

When the webpage is loaded, read in **data.json** and display the details of the animal, including its photo. Hint: You need to use either innerHTML or `appendChild`
